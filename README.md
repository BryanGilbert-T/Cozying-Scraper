# Cozying Scraper

A python web scraper to scrape a huge database of real estate on cozying.ai

I compiled it into a .exe file that you can find on ./dist/ folder, you can double click it and it will run the scraper for you.
If you need to change the python file, make sure to download the required packages first in ./requirements.txt
